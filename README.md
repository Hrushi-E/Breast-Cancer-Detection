# Breast-Cancer-Detection

Build Logistic Regression model from scratch for the task at hand and got accuracy of 0.883


Then compared against some regression models from scikit-learn. For each ML model, we performed Hyperparameter tuning to get the better models and report the better models.

Here are the algorithms used:

1 Logistic Regression	
2	Decision Tree	
3	Random Forest
4	Gradient Boosting	
5	SVC	
6	KNN	
7 XGBoost

Before Hyperparameter tuning, the results are as follows:

Here are the Hyperparameters used for each model we tested
